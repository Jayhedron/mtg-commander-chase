Deck consturction rules - As per commander rules. 99 card deck, 1 
commander. 

First player shuffles Planechase deck and deals four cards to each 
player. The four cards are each player's Planechase deck. Each player 
may look at and select order of cards in deck once at the beginning of 
the game. 

Game continues as per commander rules with below additional rules. 

New turn step: Planechase step. 

Planechase step occurs before Untap step on a player's turn. At the 
beginning of the Planechase step, the current player may choose to pay 4 
life to draw the top card of their Planechase deck and place it on the 
top of the Planechase zone. Return any cards in the Planechase zone to 
the bottom of their owner's Planechase deck. 

Each Planechase card has two effects, a Planeshift effect and a Chaos 
effect. The Planeshift effect is a continous effect which is active when 
it is the top card of the Planechase zone. At any time during a player's 
turn when that player could cast a sorcery, they may pay the Chaos tax 
to activate the Chaos effect. The Chaos tax is equal to {1} plus the 
number of players since the Planechase card has been active. (Note: This 
would mean the player who plays the Planechase card pays {2}, and the 
player to act pays {5}.
