Planechase
1- At the start of a player's turn there is a Planechase phase. 
2- During the Planechase phase the player may choose to lose 4 life. If they do, draw three cards from the top card of the Planechase deck, chose one, and place it in the Planechase zone. 
   The other cards are put on the bottom of the Planechase deck in any order. 
   The player can only do this once each turn.
3- Planechase cards have a Planeshift and a Chaos effect. The Planeshift effect is resolved as per the text on the Planechase card. 
4- The Chaos effect is treated as a sorcery and can only be cast once a turn.
5- The cost for the Chaos effect is {2} for the player who put the Planechase card in the Planechase zone. 
   It costs {2} and an additional {1} for every position a player sits to the left of the player who played the Planechase card.
